Here we introduce a dynamic DNA supramolecular matrix assembled from five unmodified, short DNA single strands, serving as a safe, multifaceted adjuvant platform. This DNA matrix elicits a robust humoral response with minimal adverse effects, generating potent neutralizing antibodies and conferring robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. Its dynamic colloidal feature prolongs the in vivo retention of both DNA and antigen, facilitating lymphatic-targeted transportation and presentation. This process leads to a robust pro-inflammatory response in both the vaccinated site and draining lymph node, which, in turn, promotes the recruitment and activation of immune cells, leading to a rapid, effective antigen-specific antibody response. The enhanced function of DNA matrix depends on the canonical TLR9-MyD88 signalling axis in dendritic cells. In addition, only right-handed, not left-handed, chirality of the DNA strands forms D-DNA matrix and promotes immune activations. Thus, this DNA matrix functions as an all-in-one adjuvant platform, opening promising avenues for future vaccine design.",2025-Jul-08,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40628957/,40628957,Nature biomedical engineering,10.1038/s41551-025-01431-7,"The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and Institute of Clinical Immunology, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.;

PubMed,Changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell electrical properties in response to viral exposure and vaccination.,Krista S P Clarke; Alexander T Stewart; Emma L Sinclair; Rebecca Lewis; Fatima H Labeed; Deborah K Dunn-Walters; Michael Pycraft Hughes,"Viral infection triggers both cellular and systemic responses in vivo. These are sometimes difficult to study since the immune system is subject to constant challenge from multiple pathogens. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a unique opportunity arose to measure the body's immune response during lockdown, when exposure to pathogens from the environment was substantially lower. This allowed measurement of COVID-naïve patients, as well as those who had recovered from COVID-19. The effects of subsequent vaccination and boosters could also be assessed. This offers two advantages; an insight into the humoral response to novel pathogens, and the opportunity to measure the ability of the body to respond to challenge from both new pathogens and those to which exposure had already occurred. In this paper, we used dielectrophoresis (DEP) to analyze the electrophysiological fingerprint of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from donors who had never had COVID-19, those who had recovered from COVID-19, and those who received first, second, or third vaccine doses. This was performed before and after incubation with the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to determine whether differential changes in the electrical properties of PBMCs could be detected and evaluated. Clear trends in response over time were observed, suggesting that DEP could pave the way towards a new correlate of protection (CoP) to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, since the test measures immune response to challenge, it may be widely applicable to other diseases.",2025-Jul-09,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40628860/,40628860,Scientific reports,10.1038/s41598-025-08724-6,"Centre for Biomedical Engineering, School of Mechanical Engineering Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH, UK.; School of Bioscience and Medicine, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH, UK.; School of Bioscience and Medicine, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH, UK.; Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH, UK.; Department of Biology, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, UAE.; School of Bioscience and Medicine, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH, UK. d.dunn-walters@surrey.ac.uk.; Department of Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology, Khalifa University of Science and Technology, Abu Dhabi, UAE. michael.hughes@ku.ac.ae."
PubMed,Trends in pediatric vaccination coverage in Italy from 2000 to 2023.,Leonardo Villani; Francesco Andrea Causio; Cosimo Savoia; Roberta Pastorino; Walter Ricciardi; Stefania Boccia; Chiara de Waure,"Vaccination represents one of the most effective public health interventions. However, a decrease in pediatric vaccination coverage has been observed in Italy, with an increase in vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. To counter this phenomenon, the Italian government approved a compulsory vaccination law in 2017, increasing the number of mandatory vaccinations from four to 10. This study analyzes the trends of vaccination coverages in Italy from 2000 to 2023, with a focus on the impact of the law. Vaccination coverage data were obtained from the Italian Ministry of Health, sorted by antigen. A linear regression and joinpoint regression analysis was performed for each antigen to identify a significant or non-significant change (increase or decrease) in the trend. Vaccination coverages declined steadily until 2015, but with the introduction of the law 119/2017, there was an increase for all antigens, ranging from 1.05% for tetanus to 5.30% for rubella. During the years of the COVID-19 pandemic, a decline in coverage was observed for all antigens, with values ranging from -0.24% for varicella to -2.39% for rubella. Implementing vaccine mandates seem to be useful for increasing vaccination coverages. Likewise, this study showed the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary healthcare services, such as vaccination, contributing to a decline in coverage. Health systems should measure vaccination coverages and monitor changes and variations to be resilient toward external stressors and be proactive in tackling crises.",2025-Jul-08,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40628384/,40628384,European journal of public health,10.1093/eurpub/ckaf107,"Department of Life Sciences and Public Health, Section of Hygiene, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.; Department of Life Sciences and Public Health, Section of Hygiene, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.; Department of Life Sciences and Public Health, Section of Hygiene, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.; Department of Life Sciences and Public Health, Section of Hygiene, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.; Department of Life Sciences and Public Health, Section of Hygiene, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.; Department of Life Sciences and Public Health, Section of Hygiene, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.; Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy."

Building on our earlier work identifying sarbecovirus receptor-binding domain (RBD) group 1 and 2 bnAbs, we now show that several of these antibodies retain neutralizing activity against highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants, including BA.2.86 and JN.1. Structural studies reveal that group 1 bnAbs use recurrent germline-encoded heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRH3) features to interact with a conserved RBD region that overlaps with class 4 bnAb site. Group 2 bnAbs recognize a less well-defined ""site V"" on the RBD and destabilize spike trimer. Notably, site V remains largely unchanged across SARS-CoV-2 variants and is conserved among diverse sarbecoviruses, highlighting its potential as a broad vaccine target.

Although neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) have garnered increasing attention, T-cells are crucial for conferring long-lasting immunity, especially their resilience against viral mutations. However, assessing T-cell responses clinically has been hindered by cost and complexity. In this study, we recruited a cohort of 134 healthy adults, who had been immunized with three doses of the SARS-CoV-2 inactivated vaccine. Cellular immunity elicited by a comprehensive array of overlapping peptides covering the entire sequence of the virus's structural proteins was assessed by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). Additionally, a dataset including demographic information, routine blood indices, and immune cell indicators comprising 32 variables was collected. Multivariate analysis revealed age and days post-vaccination as key factors influencing the strength of the T-cell response.
