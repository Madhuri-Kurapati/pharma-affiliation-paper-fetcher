Here we introduce a dynamic DNA supramolecular matrix assembled from five unmodified, short DNA single strands, serving as a safe, multifaceted adjuvant platform. This DNA matrix elicits a robust humoral response with minimal adverse effects, generating potent neutralizing antibodies and conferring robust protection against SARS-CoV-2 and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. Its dynamic colloidal feature prolongs the in vivo retention of both DNA and antigen, facilitating lymphatic-targeted transportation and presentation. This process leads to a robust pro-inflammatory response in both the vaccinated site and draining lymph node, which, in turn, promotes the recruitment and activation of immune cells, leading to a rapid, effective antigen-specific antibody response. The enhanced function of DNA matrix depends on the canonical TLR9-MyD88 signalling axis in dendritic cells. In addition, only right-handed, not left-handed, chirality of the DNA strands forms D-DNA matrix and promotes immune activations. Thus, this DNA matrix functions as an all-in-one adjuvant platform, opening promising avenues for future vaccine design.",2025-Jul-08,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40628957/,40628957,Nature biomedical engineering,10.1038/s41551-025-01431-7,"The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University and Institute of Clinical Immunology, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.;

PubMed,Changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cell electrical properties in response to viral exposure and vaccination.,Krista S P Clarke; Alexander T Stewart; Emma L Sinclair; Rebecca Lewis; Fatima H Labeed; Deborah K Dunn-Walters; Michael Pycraft Hughes,"Viral infection triggers both cellular and systemic responses in vivo. These are sometimes difficult to study since the immune system is subject to constant challenge from multiple pathogens. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, a unique opportunity arose to measure the body's immune response during lockdown, when exposure to pathogens from the environment was substantially lower. This allowed measurement of COVID-naïve patients, as well as those who had recovered from COVID-19. The effects of subsequent vaccination and boosters could also be assessed. This offers two advantages; an insight into the humoral response to novel pathogens, and the opportunity to measure the ability of the body to respond to challenge from both new pathogens and those to which exposure had already occurred. In this paper, we used dielectrophoresis (DEP) to analyze the electrophysiological fingerprint of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from donors who had never had COVID-19, those who had recovered from COVID-19, and those who received first, second, or third vaccine doses. This was performed before and after incubation with the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to determine whether differential changes in the electrical properties of PBMCs could be detected and evaluated. Clear trends in response over time were observed, suggesting that DEP could pave the way towards a new correlate of protection (CoP) to SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, since the test measures immune response to challenge, it may be widely applicable to other diseases.",2025-Jul-09,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40628860/,40628860,Scientific reports,10.1038/s41598-025-08724-6,"Centre for Biomedical Engineering, School of Mechanical Engineering Sciences, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH, UK.; School of Bioscience and Medicine, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH, UK.; School of Bioscience and Medicine, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH, UK.; Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH, UK.; Department of Biology, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, UAE.; School of Bioscience and Medicine, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey, GU2 7XH, UK. d.dunn-walters@surrey.ac.uk.; Department of Biomedical Engineering and Biotechnology, Khalifa University of Science and Technology, Abu Dhabi, UAE. michael.hughes@ku.ac.ae."
PubMed,Trends in pediatric vaccination coverage in Italy from 2000 to 2023.,Leonardo Villani; Francesco Andrea Causio; Cosimo Savoia; Roberta Pastorino; Walter Ricciardi; Stefania Boccia; Chiara de Waure,"Vaccination represents one of the most effective public health interventions. However, a decrease in pediatric vaccination coverage has been observed in Italy, with an increase in vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. To counter this phenomenon, the Italian government approved a compulsory vaccination law in 2017, increasing the number of mandatory vaccinations from four to 10. This study analyzes the trends of vaccination coverages in Italy from 2000 to 2023, with a focus on the impact of the law. Vaccination coverage data were obtained from the Italian Ministry of Health, sorted by antigen. A linear regression and joinpoint regression analysis was performed for each antigen to identify a significant or non-significant change (increase or decrease) in the trend. Vaccination coverages declined steadily until 2015, but with the introduction of the law 119/2017, there was an increase for all antigens, ranging from 1.05% for tetanus to 5.30% for rubella. During the years of the COVID-19 pandemic, a decline in coverage was observed for all antigens, with values ranging from -0.24% for varicella to -2.39% for rubella. Implementing vaccine mandates seem to be useful for increasing vaccination coverages. Likewise, this study showed the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on primary healthcare services, such as vaccination, contributing to a decline in coverage. Health systems should measure vaccination coverages and monitor changes and variations to be resilient toward external stressors and be proactive in tackling crises.",2025-Jul-08,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40628384/,40628384,European journal of public health,10.1093/eurpub/ckaf107,"Department of Life Sciences and Public Health, Section of Hygiene, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.; Department of Life Sciences and Public Health, Section of Hygiene, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.; Department of Life Sciences and Public Health, Section of Hygiene, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.; Department of Life Sciences and Public Health, Section of Hygiene, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.; Department of Life Sciences and Public Health, Section of Hygiene, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.; Department of Life Sciences and Public Health, Section of Hygiene, Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.; Department of Medicine and Surgery, University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy."

Building on our earlier work identifying sarbecovirus receptor-binding domain (RBD) group 1 and 2 bnAbs, we now show that several of these antibodies retain neutralizing activity against highly mutated SARS-CoV-2 variants, including BA.2.86 and JN.1. Structural studies reveal that group 1 bnAbs use recurrent germline-encoded heavy-chain complementarity-determining region 3 (CDRH3) features to interact with a conserved RBD region that overlaps with class 4 bnAb site. Group 2 bnAbs recognize a less well-defined ""site V"" on the RBD and destabilize spike trimer. Notably, site V remains largely unchanged across SARS-CoV-2 variants and is conserved among diverse sarbecoviruses, highlighting its potential as a broad vaccine target.

This calls for the development of an innovative booster vaccine, or vaccination strategy, that will eliminate, or attenuate, OAS, thus, enhancing broad-neutralizing antibody (bnAb) response. Accordingly, we herein proposed a leveraged vaccination strategy to counter the OAS effect by controlling the antigenic distance of booster vaccine and increasing boost vaccination frequency. We found that prime with WT-RBD and boost with XBB-RBD resulted in significantly higher bnAb response against most Omicron subvariants tested than that after prime with WT-RBD and boost with BA.2-RBD because the antigenic distance between WT-RBD and XBB-RBD is much longer than that between WT-RBD and BA.2-RBD. An additional boost with XBB-RBD further enhanced bnAb response. These findings indicate that a leveraged vaccination approach based on antigenic distance could be effective in reducing OAS, thereby strengthening bnAb response against SARS-CoV-2 Omicron subvariants. As such, this vaccination strategy could be just as effective in combating other fast-evolving RNA viruses known for their high transmissibility and infectivity.",2025-Jul,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40626318/,40626318,MedComm,10.1002/mco2.70273,"Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (Ministry of Education/National Health Commission/Chinese Academy of Medical Science), Shanghai Institute of Infectious Disease and Biosecurity, School of Basic Medical Sciences Fudan University Shanghai China.; Key Laboratory of Medical Molecular Virology (Ministry of Education/National Health Commission/Chinese Academy of Medical Science), Shanghai Institute of Infectious Disease and Biosecurity, School of Basic Medical Sciences Fudan University Shanghai China.; Suzhou Abogen Biosciences Co., Ltd.

PubMed,The dual threat: exploring the emergence of human metapneumovirus and SARS-CoV-2 coinfections in respiratory infections.,Falguni Goel; Daksh Kumar; Payal Singh; Sachchida Nand Rai,"SARS-CoV-2-triggered COVID-19 epidemic has thrown unprecedented challenges at the global public health system but has also drawn attention to the co-circulation of other respiratory viruses, among them human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Both viruses are significant contributors to respiratory illnesses. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) can cause serious respiratory infections, particularly in young children, elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. This review explores the overlap between human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and SARS-CoV-2, focusing on their epidemiological patterns, clinical manifestations, and the impact of co-infection on disease severity and patient outcomes. We consider the molecular mechanisms of hMPV's interaction with the host immune system, which might have an impact or exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. The challenges of identifying and treating co-infections are also discussed in this study as are the effects of clinical management during the present pandemic. Furthermore, the possibilities of synergistic effects between the two viruses involved in these coinfections, particularly modified immune response and worsened respiratory outcomes, have been brought up. We address the intersection of these two viral pathogens to provide insights into their combined burden on healthcare systems, underscore the need for improved diagnostic tools, and advocate for research on targeted treatment and vaccine strategies. This review highlights the dual threat posed by hMPV and SARS-CoV-2 and calls for greater attention to the implications of viral co-infections in respiratory diseases.",2025-Aug,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40625421/,40625421,3 Biotech,10.1007/s13205-025-04384-5,"Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Meerut Institute of Engineering & Technology (MIET), Meerut, India.; Department of Pharmaceutical Technology, Meerut Institute of Engineering & Technology (MIET), Meerut, India.; Department of Zoology, Institute of Science, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, 221005 India.; Centre of Experimental Medicine & Surgery, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India."

Using weekly, district-specific time series data, we examined whether the effect and underlying pathways of social distancing policies on changes in COVID-19 incidence and mobility differ between commercial and non-commercial districts in Seoul. We employed the Vector Autoregression with Exogenous variables (VARX) model to analyze the interdependencies among COVID-19 incidences, mobility patterns, and social distancing policies over time from June 2020 to November 2021 across Seoul, including district-specific effects. The model incorporated vaccination coverage as an external variable to account for population-level immunity. Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) were used to interpret the results of the citywide VARX model, illustrating how changes in one variable influenced others over time. Social distancing policies had minimal direct effects on incidence rates but indirectly reduced them by decreasing mobility. Mobility observed two weeks prior demonstrated a positive correlation with current COVID-19 incidence, particularly in commercial districts, indicating that increased movement significantly contributes to transmission. On the other hand, rising COVID-19 cases led to decreased mobility, especially in non-commercial districts, likely driven by fear of infection and heightened self-restriction. Policies were more effective in reducing mobility within commercial districts, likely due to stricter enforcement and higher population density, which amplified compliance impacts. Reduced mobility in commercial districts following stricter policies indicates that targeted restrictions in high-traffic areas can effectively help control COVID-19 transmission in Seoul. In contrast, the more pronounced voluntary movement reductions in non-commercial areas, driven by increased incidence, suggest that enhanced regular testing could play a more significant role in disease control in these regions. While policies reduce mobility, their slower impact on incidence rates, at least a two-week time lag, highlights the need for proactive implementation to achieve measurable decreases in transmission.",2025-Jul-07,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40624117/,40624117,Scientific reports,10.1038/s41598-025-05583-z,"Department of Statistics, University of Connecticut, Storr, CT, USA.; Department of Statistics, Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea.; Korea Institute for International Economic Policy, Sejong, South Korea.; Department of Public Health Sciences, School of Medicine, University of Connecticut, Farmington, CT, USA. jo@uchc.edu.; Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul, South Korea. eastside1st@gmail.com."

Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) were among the most highly affected groups by the COVID-19 pandemic due to their underlying conditions. This study aimed to establish the prevalence and identify the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine uptake among PWDs in three selected districts of Zambia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from June to August 2023 in Lusaka, Mazabuka, and Monze Districts. Structured questionnaires were developed and administered to PWDs aged 18 years and above. Log-binomial model was used to calculate the adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for assessing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and its determinants. Out of the sample of 985, the proportion of COVID-19 vaccine uptake was 67.6% (95% CI: 65%, 71%). Vaccine uptake was higher among the married (aPR: 1.21; 95% CI:1.06, 1.39) participants from Mazabuka District (aPR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.34, 1.93) living in rural areas (aPR:1.27; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.49) having extra income (aPR:1.27; 95% CI: 1.09,1.50) involved in routine health checkup (aPR:1.23; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.37) previously infected with COVID-19 (aPR:1.32; 95% CI, 1.04-1.68) previously vaccinated (aPR: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.33) and understanding safety of the vaccine (aPR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.55, 3.49). Conversely, low vaccine uptake was observed among participants earning less than k200 from social cash transfer (aPR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.87). More research is needed to identify determinants of vaccine uptake among PWDs that make them more vulnerable to infectious diseases such as COVID-19. There is need to improve vaccination coverage among PWDs. A more holistic and inclusive health promotion approach needs to be adopted to ensure that PWDs are not left behind in accessing vaccines.",2025,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40623023/,40623023,PLOS global public health,10.1371/journal.pgph.0003868,"Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia.; Department of Medical Education, School of Medicine, University of Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia.; Department of Health Promotion, School of Public Health, University of Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia.; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia."
PubMed,Arsenic trioxide could promote SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 protein degradation.,Tao Yang; Chen Ying Zhu; Pei Han Yu; Chang Yang; Hua Naranmandura,"The global dissemination and infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have become a worldwide crisis with staggering confirmed cases and death tolls. Although prophylactic vaccines are widely applied to curb the spread of the virus, these protections are greatly weakened by the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Non-structural protein 12 (NSP12) of SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that plays an essential role in viral replication and transcription, representing a promising target for drug development. Currently, extensive drugs are designed to specifically target and inhibit NSP12 activity, while highly infectious and drug-resistant variants have significantly compromised their efficacy. Here, we identified that arsenic trioxide (ATO) could specifically reduce not only WT SARS-CoV-2 NSP12 but also mutant NSP12 levels, along with low toxicity. Moreover, the reduction of NSP12 was caused by its robust ubiquitination and subsequent degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway after ATO treatment. Of note, STIP1 homology and U-box containing protein 1 was found to be the E3 ligase responsible for the ubiquitination and degradation of NSP12 by ATO. In short, our findings provide a potential intervention to restrict virus replication and may broaden the scope of therapeutic application for ATO.",2025-Jul,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40622852/,40622852,The Journal of general virology,10.1099/jgv.0.002121,"Department of Public Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310058, PR China.; Department of Public Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310058, PR China.; Department of Public Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310058, PR China.; Department of Public Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310058, PR China.; Department of Public Health, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310058, PR China."

Engineered Antibody-like proteins (ALPs) targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein are engineered to address immune dysregulation in COVID-19. In this study, Lectifitin-36 and Lectifitin-41, two such ALPs, are developed using cDNA display technology. These ALPs demonstrate strong binding affinity for the spike protein and effectively inhibit its interaction with ACE2 and several C-type lectins, including MBL, DC-SIGN, and L-SIGN. Both in vitro and in vivo analyses reveal that Lectifitin-36 and Lectifitin-41 suppress complement activation via the lectin pathway, reduce neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and attenuate hyper-inflammatory responses. In mouse models, Lectifitin-36 and Lectifitin-41 significantly mitigate inflammation, NETosis, and lung tissue damage induced by the spike protein. These results suggest that these ALPs hold promise as therapeutic candidates for alleviating SARS-CoV-2-induced immune dysfunction, with the potential to reduce severe COVID-19 outcomes and long-term sequelae.

In this study, we aimed to assess immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in children over the age of 12 years with previous MIS-C and compare them to healthy children. Three children with previous MIS-C and four healthy children received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Blood was collected before the first dose, one week after the first dose, one week after the second dose and three weeks after the second dose. All participants had detectable SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG before vaccination. Spike binding and neutralising antibody activity increased after the first vaccine dose with no differences between children with a history of MIS-C and healthy children. Serum inflammatory cytokines and whole blood immune gene profiles did not resemble acute MIS-C and there were no differences in these between the two groups at any timepoint. All participants gained a robust SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell response by three weeks after the second dose. A transient increase in SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4 T cells expressing TCR Vβ21.3, a non-specific T cell subset previously found to be enriched in patients with MIS-C, was demonstrated in two of the children with previous MIS-C but none of the healthy children. Together, these data demonstrate that vaccination is effective at boosting SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses in a small group of children with previous MIS-C, and that it does not induce inflammatory cytokine or gene expression responses resembling acute MIS-C.

Consecutive exposures predominantly back-boost pre-existing immunity and expand cross-neutralizing antibodies while de novo variant-specific responses are poorly induced. In this study, we analyzed neutralizing antibodies against a panel of variants in plasma samples from individuals after exactly two exposures: twice pre-Omicron variant (either two dose vaccinated or infected and one dose vaccinated), pre-Omicron followed by early Omicron variant, or twice early Omicron variant. We found that exposure to two antigenically distinct variants, either pre-Omicron followed by Omicron or two different Omicron variants, increased the neutralization breadth. However, no significant cross-neutralization against the genetically closely related human coronavirus SARS-CoV was induced. Using depletion experiments, we showed that the first exposed variant strongly influences the specificity of antibodies. The second exposure primarily expanded cross-reactive antibodies rather than inducing a variant-specific response against the later variant, highlighting the phenomenon of immune imprinting in the context of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, our results indicate that multiple exposures to SARS-CoV-2 improve cross-neutralization against a variety of variants, but also underscore the lack of de novo antibody production against the more recently encountered variant.",2025-Jul-04,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40617091/,40617091,Vaccine,10.1016/j.vaccine.2025.127459,"Institute of Virology, Department of Hygiene, Microbiology and Virology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Peter-Mayr-Str. 4b, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.; Institute of Virology, Department of Hygiene, Microbiology and Virology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Peter-Mayr-Str. 4b, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria; Center for Virology and Vaccine Research, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.; University of Cambridge, Centre for Pathogen Evolution, Department of Zoology, Cambridge, UK.; Tyrolpath Obrist Brunhuber GmbH, Hauptplatz 4, 6511, Zams, Austria.; Institute of Virology, Department of Hygiene, Microbiology and Virology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Peter-Mayr-Str. 4b, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.; University of Regensburg, Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, Regensburg, Germany.; Institute of Virology, Department of Hygiene, Microbiology and Virology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Peter-Mayr-Str. 4b, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.; Institute of Virology, Department of Hygiene, Microbiology and Virology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Peter-Mayr-Str. 4b, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.; Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Center for Vaccine Research and Pandemic Preparedness (C-VARPP), Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.; Department of Microbiology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Center for Vaccine Research and Pandemic Preparedness (C-VARPP), Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA; Ignaz Semmelweis Institute, Institute for Infection Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.; Institute of Virology, Department of Hygiene, Microbiology and Virology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Peter-Mayr-Str. 4b, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.; University of Regensburg, Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, Regensburg, Germany; University Hospital Regensburg, Institute of Clinical Microbiology and Hygiene, Regensburg, Germany.; University of Cambridge, Centre for Pathogen Evolution, Department of Zoology, Cambridge, UK.; Institute of Virology, Department of Hygiene, Microbiology and Virology, Medical University of Innsbruck, Peter-Mayr-Str. 4b, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.

A study was a retrospective cohort study conducted in Osijek-Baranja County, Croatia, between December 27, 2020, and May 12, 2023. A total of 119,596 subjects of both sexes and all age groups were analyzed. The method of survival analysis was used. The length of protection (LoP) for 95 % and 90 % of the population with first infection was 256 (confidence interval (CI) 251-264) days and 365 (CI 350-381) days, respectively. In those primarily vaccinated, the longest duration of protection was recorded in subjects having received primary homologous vaccination with Spikevax (Moderna), 143 (CI 133-150) and 192 (CI 183-201) days, followed by those with Comirnaty (BioNTech/Pfizer), 119 (CI 116-122) and 168 (CI 165-170) days, respectively.

Here, we longitudinally tracked B cells that recognize the wild-type spike in two individuals who were repeatedly infected by Omicron variants after receiving prototype mRNA vaccines. Functional and genetic analysis of 632 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from those B cells reveals that mAbs cloned after a second infection have dramatically enhanced neutralizing breadth and potency due to immune recalls. Among the eleven mAbs that broadly neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants from the wild type to KP.3, five mAbs are classified into public clonotypes encoded by IGHV3-53 or IGHV3-66, whereas the rest belong to a rare clonotype encoded by IGHV3-74. Notably, IGHV3-74 mAbs can also potently neutralize other sarbecoviruses by targeting a non-dominant epitope partially overlapping with receptor-binding domain (RBD)-3 and RBD-5.

PubMed,Association between 25(OH)D levels and clinical outcomes in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2: a cross-sectional study.,Aleksandra Starosz; Anna Parfieniuk-Kowerda; Diana Martonik; Anna Moniuszko-Malinowska; Sławomir Pancewicz; Robert Flisiak; Marcin Moniuszko; Kamil Grubczak,"SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus that caused one of the most significant pandemics in the modern world. Although vaccination and treatment options have advanced, understanding host-related factors influencing disease severity remains critical, especially in the context of emerging variants and long-term complications. Since the beginning, numerous research studies have been conducted to better understand the mechanisms contributing to the severe onset of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Immunomodulatory properties of vitamin D are known for their positive impact on multiple conditions. Nevertheless, clinical trials suggested that vitamin D deficiency did not have as substantial a role as expected in conditions including asthma, cardiovascular or autoimmune diseases, and cancer. Moreover, low vitamin D levels could result from the ongoing inflammatory process. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed the level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in hospitalized SARS-CoV-2-infected patients using immunoenzymatic tests (ELISA). Furthermore, the expression of the ORF1ab gene was detected, and the obtained results were correlated with laboratory parameters to establish their potential impact on the course of the disease. Severe 25(OH)D deficiency was found in subjects with active SARS-CoV-2 infection. We showed a significant relationship between 25(OH)D and extended hospitalization time. No link was demonstrated between vitamin D levels and clinical manifestations. Lower 25(OH)D values were associated with lower values of leukocytes, neutrophils and ferritin. In summary, our findings highlight the relevance of vitamin D status as a potential modulator of immune response and disease course in SARS-CoV-2 infection, underscoring the importance of continued investigation into host nutritional and inflammatory profiles during COVID-19.",2025-Jul-04,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40615533/,40615533,Scientific reports,10.1038/s41598-025-08621-y,"Department of Regenerative Medicine and Immune Regulation, Medical University of Bialystok, Jerzego Waszyngtona 13, 15-269, Bialystok, Poland. aleksandra.starosz@umb.edu.pl.; Department of Infectious Diseases and Hepatology, Medical University of Bialystok, Zurawia 14, 15-540, Bialystok, Poland.; Department of Infectious Diseases and Hepatology, Medical University of Bialystok, Zurawia 14, 15-540, Bialystok, Poland.; Department of Infectious Diseases and Neuroinfection, Medical University of Bialystok, Zurawia 14, 15-540, Bialystok, Poland.; Department of Infectious Diseases and Neuroinfection, Medical University of Bialystok, Zurawia 14, 15-540, Bialystok, Poland.; Department of Infectious Diseases and Hepatology, Medical University of Bialystok, Zurawia 14, 15-540, Bialystok, Poland.; Department of Regenerative Medicine and Immune Regulation, Medical University of Bialystok, Jerzego Waszyngtona 13, 15-269, Bialystok, Poland.; Department of Regenerative Medicine and Immune Regulation, Medical University of Bialystok, Jerzego Waszyngtona 13, 15-269, Bialystok, Poland. kamil.grubczak@umb.edu.pl."

To investigate the suitability of the Syrian hamster model to test for VAED, we immunized animals with an experimental formaldehyde-inactivated, alum-adjuvanted SARS-CoV-2 vaccine preparation. In two independent experiments, challenge infection did not result in an enhancement of the clinical disease in vaccinated animals compared with mock-vaccinated animals.

To reduce reliance on neutralizing antibodies and prevent potential mismatches between circulating variants, sub-variants, and the vaccines, we have identified highly conserved Spike and non-Spike viral epitopes associated with protective asymptomatic B- and T-cell immune responses, respectively.
