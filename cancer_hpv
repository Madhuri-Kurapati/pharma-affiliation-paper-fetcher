However, it remains unclear which sequence differences lead to virulence or attenuation. Here we demonstrate, using SHAPE-MaP, that these mutations do not induce global RNA structure changes and show that protein sequence mutations are mostly responsible for the phenotypic differences between 17D and virulent YFV. Using a highly modular, combinatorial genetic approach, we identified key mutations in the envelope (E) and non-structural 2A (NS2A) proteins that increase 17D's ability to spread and enhance host antiviral responses. Introducing these mutations into infectious clones of virulent YFV genomes results in viral attenuation in vitro and in two mouse models.

The limited effectiveness of traditional immunotherapies, particularly in advanced stages of the disease, highlights an urgent need for innovative treatment options. Cancer vaccines represent a promising Frontier in this battle, aiming to harness the power of the immune system to create lasting memory against tumor cells. This approach not only promotes tumor regression but also does so with minimal adverse effects. The death of tumor cells induced by these vaccines triggers a cascade of immune responses, activating functional T cells and sustaining the cancer-immunity cycle. Among emerging platforms, RNA-based vaccines have garnered particular attention for their rapid development potential, flexible design, and ability to induce robust cellular and humoral immunity. As a result, cancer vaccines-including RNA-based modalities-are increasingly viewed as a groundbreaking therapeutic strategy in the immunotherapy landscape for solid tumors.

KRAS mutations, particularly the G12D mutation which dominates in PDAC, fuel tumor initiation, progression, and immune evasion, thereby contributing to therapy resistance. Nevertheless, KRAS has long been considered ""undruggable"" due to its structure. Recent advances have spurred transformative progress in direct KRAS inhibition. While FDA-approved mutation-specific and pan-KRAS inhibitors show limited efficacy in PDAC, emerging agents (MRTX1133 and RMC-9805) have demonstrated preclinical promise. However, resistance remains a critical hurdle and is driven by pathway reactivation, secondary mutations, and metabolic adaptations. Alternative strategies targeting upstream regulators (SHP2 and SOS1) aim to block KRAS activation and associated resistance mechanisms. Preclinical studies have also highlighted synergistic benefits of combining KRAS inhibitors with MEK, PI3K, or CDK4/6 inhibitors, which are now undergoing clinical evaluation. Immunotherapies, including KRAS-targeted vaccines and adoptive T-cell therapies, have further expanded the therapeutic landscape of enhancing KRAS-targeted therapies in PDAC.

In this regard, protein-altering modifications in cancerous cells are being deciphered in light of the predicted preferential binding of the mutated peptides by the patient's immune system constituents. Herein, we first scrutinize the immunogenicity caused by neoplasm-associated antigens and then the ways of identifying and predicting cancer neoantigens. This overview also addresses developed and ongoing neoantigen-based personalized vaccines and targeted drug delivery approaches using these cancerous antigens, as well as considerations for clinical research of this novel, individualized approach to immunotherapy.",2025-Jul-05,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40623606/,40623606,International journal of pharmaceutics,10.1016/j.ijpharm.2025.125924,"Department of Medical Nanotechnology, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.

Despite advances in standard treatments, such as surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, patient outcomes remain poor, driving the need for innovative therapeutic approaches. Cellular immune theranostics, which combines therapeutic and diagnostic capabilities, has emerged as a promising strategy to combat glioblastoma. The present review discusses recent advances in cellular immunotherapy, including the development and application of chimeric antigen receptor T cells, chimeric antigen receptor natural killer cells, and macrophage-based therapies. In addition, this review highlights the potential of oncolytic viruses and personalized tumor vaccines for improving immunotherapy outcomes. The integration of advanced diagnostic tools, such as the real-time monitoring of therapeutic responses through immunobiomarkers and imaging techniques, is emphasized as crucial for optimizing treatment strategies. However, important challenges remain, including the complexity of immune cell engineering, the difficulties of therapeutic delivery across the blood-brain barrier, and the immunosuppressive properties of the tumor microenvironment.

Leveraging these characteristics, iPSCs hold great promise for developing wide-spectrum vaccines against cancers. In practice, iPSCs are typically combined with immune adjuvants to enhance antitumor immune responses; however, traditional adjuvants lack controllability and can induce systemic toxicity, which has limited their broad application. Here, a red/far-red light-controlled iPSC-based vaccine (RIVA) based on the chimeric photosensory protein FnBphP and its interaction partner LDB3 is developed; RIVA preserves the intrinsic tumor antigens of iPSCs and enables optogenetic control of an immune adjuvant's (IFN-β) expression under red light illumination. Experiments in multiple mouse tumor models demonstrate that RIVA inhibits tumor growth and improves animal survival in prophylactic and therapeutic settings, including against pulmonary metastatic 4T1 breast cancer.

One of the major intestinal microbial metabolites of green tea polyphenols, 5-(3',5'-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone (EGC-M5), enhances T cell activity. However, the detailed underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we revealed that the oral administration of EGC-M5 increases and activates plasma cytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in the spleen without causing changes in body weight. Consistent with these findings, administration of EGC-M5 increased the gene expression of interleukin-12 in the spleen. Oral administration of EGC-M5 significantly increased type I Interferon (IFN) and IL-6 levels, which are involved in vaccine-induced antibody production. Ex vivo experiments showed that EGC-M5 treatment did not directly enhance pDC differentiation.

PubMed,Design of a novel multiepitope vaccine against glioblastoma by in silico approaches.,Sako Mirzaie; Kevin Da Yuan; Heyu Ni; Xiao Yu Wu,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor, with a median survival rate of less than two years. Currently, there is no cure for GBM, underscoring the urgent need for innovative treatment approaches. Vaccine design emerges as a crucial strategy, offering a safe and effective means for both preventive and therapeutic interventions against GBM. In this study, we targeted four GBM-associated mutated surface proteins-urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor (PLAUR), integrin beta-3 (ITGB3), and the B-41 alpha chain (HLA-B) and A-24 alpha chain (HLA-A) of the HLA class I histocompatibility antigens-to design a peptide-based vaccine. The vaccine construct includes cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and T helper cell (Th cell) epitopes, and was meticulously evaluated for antigenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity. The results indicate that the vaccine is antigenic and non-allergenic, making it a promising candidate.

PubMed,Microbial-induced trained immunity for cancer immunotherapy.,Patricia Vuscan; Brenda Kischkel; Leo A B Joosten; Mihai G Netea,"Myeloid innate immune cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and dendritic cells, represent major components of the tumor microenvironment (TME), exhibiting remarkable plasticity and dual roles in cancer progression and immune regulation. In recent years, microbial-induced innate immune memory, also termed ""trained immunity"" (TRIM), has emerged as a novel strategy to reprogram myeloid cells into an immunostimulatory, antitumor state. In this review, we explore the intricate landscape of myeloid cells in cancer and examine how microbial ligands, such as the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine and β-glucan, reprogram both bone marrow progenitors and tissue-resident myeloid cells to enhance inflammatory and antitumor responses. Notable findings include the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell reprogramming by Bacillus Calmette-Guérin for sustained anticancer immunity, and the enhanced granulopoiesis and neutrophil-mediated tumor killing mediated by β-glucan-induced TRIM. These mechanisms synergize with immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, by reshaping the immunosuppressive TME and enhancing adaptive immunity. However, challenges remain, including the structural complexity of microbial products, the lack of predictive biomarkers, and the need for optimized dosing and delivery strategies. Addressing these gaps by introducing precise characterization of microbial-derived ligands, biomarker-driven patient selection through large-scale clinical trials, as well as the development of novel approaches for targeted therapy will be essential to harness the full potential of microbial-induced TRIM, ultimately paving the way for more effective and durable cancer immunotherapies. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Tumor-promoting myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment remain a major barrier to effective cancer immunotherapy. Microbial-induced trained immunity offers a novel strategy to reprogram myeloid cells into an antitumor state. This review provides a comprehensive overview of myeloid cell populations in cancer and the mechanisms underlying microbial-induced trained immunity. It also highlights preclinical and clinical evidence demonstrating the efficacy of microbial-based strategies in overcoming immunosuppression and synergizing with existing immunotherapies, offering a promising approach to improve cancer treatment outcomes.",2025-Jun-12,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40616857/,40616857,Pharmacological reviews,10.1016/j.pharmr.2025.100074,"Department of Internal Medicine and Radboud Center of Infectious Diseases (RCI), Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.; Department of Internal Medicine and Radboud Center of Infectious Diseases (RCI), Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.; Department of Internal Medicine and Radboud Center of Infectious Diseases (RCI), Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; Department of Medical Genetics, Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca, Romania.; Department of Internal Medicine and Radboud Center of Infectious Diseases (RCI), Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands; Department for Immunology and Metabolism, Life and Medical Sciences Institute (LIMES), University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.

Here, we longitudinally tracked B cells that recognize the wild-type spike in two individuals who were repeatedly infected by Omicron variants after receiving prototype mRNA vaccines. Functional and genetic analysis of 632 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from those B cells reveals that mAbs cloned after a second infection have dramatically enhanced neutralizing breadth and potency due to immune recalls. Among the eleven mAbs that broadly neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants from the wild type to KP.3, five mAbs are classified into public clonotypes encoded by IGHV3-53 or IGHV3-66, whereas the rest belong to a rare clonotype encoded by IGHV3-74.

To understand the molecular epidemiology of KSHV in this region, samples were collected from people living with HIV (PWH) with or without history of KAD. PWH, mainly men who have sex with men (MSM), were recruited from a large, urban hospital system in Dallas, Texas, in two separate studies. The studies included 220 individuals without KAD and 59 patients with KAD. Whole blood and/or oral fluids were collected and tested by qPCR. KSHV subtypes were determined from 66 of 85 individuals with detectable KSHV loads by a combination of next-generation and targeted Sanger sequencing. All major KSHV subtypes, except D, were observed including subtypes E and F. In each of three individuals, multiple KSHV genome variants were identified.

PubMed,mRNA vaccines and SiRNAs targeting cancer immunotherapy: challenges and opportunities.,Zhen Lv; Yuheng Dai,"RNA-based cancer immunotherapy is promising in oncology, leveraging the immune system's ability to target and eliminate cancer cells. This strategy primarily utilizes messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines and small interfering RNA (siRNA) to modulate the immune response, presenting a novel and adaptable platform for cancer treatment. mRNA vaccines can encode tumor-specific antigens, stimulating robust and tailored immune responses, while siRNA can silence oncogenes, reducing tumor growth and enhancing immune recognition. Despite its potential, RNA-based immunotherapy faces several challenges. The inherent instability of RNA molecules and their susceptibility to degradation by nucleases pose significant hurdles for effective delivery. Developing delivery systems that can efficiently target tumor cells while minimizing off-target effects remains a critical challenge. Immune-related adverse events, such as cytokine release syndrome, also raise concerns about the safety and specificity of these therapies. However, advancements in RNA modification techniques, such as incorporating nucleoside analogs and developing lipid nanoparticles, have improved RNA stability and delivery efficiency. Moreover, the ability to rapidly design and produce RNA molecules allows for the customization of therapies to individual patients, offering a personalized approach to cancer treatment. In conclusion, while RNA-based cancer immunotherapy holds great promise, addressing the challenges related to RNA stability, delivery, and immune specificity is crucial. Continued research and technological innovations are essential to fully harness the therapeutic potential of RNA in oncology, offering new hope in the fight against cancer.",2025-Jul-05,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40615758/,40615758,Discover oncology,10.1007/s12672-025-03070-5,"Division of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Department of Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, 310003, China.; Department of obstetrics, Hangzhou Women's Hospital, Hangzhou, 310008, China. adai_q@126.com.",

The potential of PLK1 inhibitors as cancer therapeutics has been extensively investigated. However, the underlying biology and mechanisms of PLK1 remain incompletely understood. In recent years, numerous studies have demonstrated that PLK1 overexpression is associated with resistance to certain chemotherapeutic agents, while its inhibition can enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy. In addition, PLK1 inhibitors have been shown to selectively target cancer cells as radiation sensitizers and exert synergistic effects in combination immunotherapy. The underlying mechanisms may involve the regulation of multiple immune cells and inflammatory factors, as well as alterations in the tumor microenvironment, ultimately influencing tumor genesis, migration, and invasion. Moreover, PLK1 can regulate the expression of immune checkpoint-related proteins, thereby playing a synergistic role in cancer therapy.

PubMed,Immunogenicity and innate immunity to high-dose and repeated vaccination of modified mRNA versus unmodified mRNA.,Olivia Engstrand; Gustav Joas; Marcos C Miranda; Xianglei Yan; Klara Lenart; Rodrigo Arcoverde Cerveira; Annika Reinhardt; Karin Loré,"mRNA vaccines represent a new era with several novel constructs underway. We compared the responses of high doses and multiple repetitive immunizations of a nucleoside-modified mRNA construct to a sequence-codon-optimized unmodified mRNA construct encoding the identical model antigen (HIV-1 gag). Rhesus macaques were immunized five times at 2-week intervals, with a final boost 20 weeks later. At 24 h post-vaccination, both unmodified (160 μg) and modified (400 μg and 800 μg) mRNA constructs elicited clear but transient increase of plasmacytoid dendritic cells, intermediate CD14+ CD16+ monocytes, and neutrophils along with secretion of type I interferon (IFN)-related and inflammatory cytokines. Unmodified mRNA induced higher interleukin-7 (IL-7) and IFN-α levels, whereas modified mRNA induced higher IL-6 levels. Transcriptomic profiling showed significant upregulation of genes related to type I IFN signaling, antigen presentation, and innate immune activation induced by both mRNA constructs.

This decline leads to chronic inflammation, increased vulnerability to infections, cancer, autoimmune diseases, and reduced vaccine efficacy. As individuals age, the HSC niche undergoes significant changes, including greater adipocyte accumulation and alterations in the molecular microenvironment, which may influence the development and function of immune cells. Among these cells, the impact of the aging HSC niche on dendritic cell (DC) function is less understood. Heterochronic autologous HSC transplantation is a promising intervention to prevent age-related disorders, contributing to the extension of healthspan and longevity, however, several murine experiments failed to produce the expected results, which led us to presume that the problem lies within the old HSC niche. Therefore, we created in vitro models of young and old HSC niches and examined how these microenvironments affect the differentiation and maturation and functionality of BM-derived DCs (BMDCs).",2025-Jul-03,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40611134/,40611134,Immunity & ageing : I & A,10.1186/s12979-025-00517-9,"Slovenian Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Šlajmerjeva ulica 6, Ljubljana, SI-1000, Slovenia.; Slovenian Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Šlajmerjeva ulica 6, Ljubljana, SI-1000, Slovenia.; Slovenian Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Šlajmerjeva ulica 6, Ljubljana, SI-1000, Slovenia.; Slovenian Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Šlajmerjeva ulica 6, Ljubljana, SI-1000, Slovenia.; Slovenian Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Šlajmerjeva ulica 6, Ljubljana, SI-1000, Slovenia. primoz.rozman@ztm.si.",

However, the metastatic CRC with microsatellite stability (MSS) does not respond to this approach. A recent study revealed that rare neoantigens in MSS-type CRC cells can be recognized by antigen-specific CD8+ T cells but not by dendritic cells (DCs). Thus, increasing neoantigen availability by DCs may improve the efficacy of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in MSS-type CRC. Here, we conducted a drug library screening for 'eat me' signal, represented by cell surface calreticulin (CRT) exposure, in MSS-type CT26 cells. Cells treated with identified cepharanthine (CEP) presented hallmarks of immunogenic cell death (ICD), characterized by increased cell surface CRT exposure, the release of HMGB1 and ATP, increased susceptibility to phagocytosis, and the ability of vaccines to elicit immunogenic potential in vivo. Mechanistically, CEP blocked autophagic flux by inhibiting autophagsome-lysosome fusion, leading to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ICD activation. Moreover, CEP upregulated PD-L1 expression on tumour cells, impeding the antitumour immune response in vivo.

HPV vaccines have proven efficacy in preventing persistent anogenital HPV infections. However, less is known regarding vaccine efficacy against persistent oral HPV infection, the obligate precursor of OPSCC. In 2020, the 9-valent HPV (9vHPV) vaccine received accelerated approval from the FDA for the indication of prevention of HPV-related OPSCC and other head and neck cancers, pending confirmation of clinical benefit in further trials. Currently a Phase III trial is ongoing to evaluate efficacy of the 9vHPV vaccine in preventing persistent oral HPV infection in immunocompetent men (NCT04199689); however, no trials have been conducted in people living with HIV. Here we describe the rationale, design, and study population characteristics of the first randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and immunogenicity of the 9vHPV vaccine in preventing persistent oral HPV infection in men aged 20-50 living with HIV. The primary objective is to demonstrate that the 9vHPV vaccine when given in a 3-dose regimen (Day 1, Months 2 and 6) reduces the incidence of persistent (≥6 months) oral HPV infection with 9vHPV vaccine types 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 in men living with HIV who are oral HPV negative to the relevant HPV type at enrollment, compared with placebo. The trial began in February 2021 and completed enrollment of 700 men at clinical sites in Brazil, Mexico, and Puerto Rico in February 2024. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the vaccine-induced serum anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 responses, and the safety and tolerability of the 9vHPV vaccine in men living with HIV.

The extensive genetic variation in HLA alleles across the region underscores the need for population-specific immunogenetic data to guide T-cell vaccine development. This study analysed Class I HLA data from Eastern and Southern African populations to assess regional genetic diversity. Analyses included allele and haplotype frequency distributions, deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, linkage disequilibrium, and homozygosity test of neutrality across various populations. To further contextualise African HLA diversity, comparisons were made among African populations and also with African American and European American populations using the Hellinger diversity index and multidimensional scaling methods. The results revealed that South African populations exhibited an estimated average of 34.1% genetic diversity with respect to other African populations. Rwanda demonstrated an estimated 26.9% genetic diversity, Kenya (26.5%), Zambia (26.5%), and Uganda (24.7%). Additionally, in-country analyses revealed variations in HLA diversity among different tribes within each country. The estimated average in-country diversity was 51% in Kenya, 35.8% in Uganda, and 33.2% in Zambia. These results reveal various levels of genetic diversity among African populations. The highlighted differences in HLA Class I allele frequencies between Eastern and Southern African populations compared to US populations, demonstrate that it is inappropriate to extrapolate HLA data from US populations including that of African Americans when designing T-cell-inducing vaccines tailored to African populations.

In addition, P. aeruginosa is a cause of difficult to treat chronic infections due to its ability to form biofilms. Therefore, pseudomonal vaccines have been proposed as alternative strategies to combat these infections for the last 50 years, however, no vaccines are available on the market for human use. The aim of this study was to investigate the capacity of a vaccine composed of seven antigens, identified using EDEN™ (Efficacy Discriminative Educated Network) - a proteome-wide in silico antigen prediction model within AI-Immunology™ platform - in improving outcomes in a murine model of chronic P. aeruginosa lung infection. The primary endpoint was quantitative bacteriology (Colony forming units - CFU) in the lungs of immunized animals compared to control animals. The secondary endpoints were clinical signs (a clinical score), body temperature and weight loss. Mice immunized with the heptavalent combination vaccine had a significantly 1.2 log10 lower lung CFU compared to the control group. Furthermore, the vaccinated mice presented significantly fewer clinical signs of infection, had less reduction in body temperature and weight loss as, compared to control mice. There was a statistically significant correlation between the lung bacteriology and secondary endpoints. Antibodies against all seven antigens were measured by ELISA confirming their immunogenicity.

On 14 August 2024, the World Health Organization declared the continued cross-border spread of this clade in Africa a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). Clade I MPXV is known to be more fatal than clade IIb, but its clinical characteristics and prognosis differ between patients. Here, we used mathematical modeling to quantify temporal changes in total lesion counts during clade I MPXV infections, using data from a large cohort of patients with mpox in the DRC from 2007 to 2011. We further analyzed individuals' clinical data to explore predictive biomarkers of high lesion counts. Our analysis indicates that patients with clade I mpox can be stratified into two groups according to lesion severity and that viral load in peripheral blood at symptom onset may serve as a predictor for this classification [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.70]. Our estimates also suggest substantial individual heterogeneity in the time period during which patients have lesions, ranging from 20 to 65 days. Understanding the severity and duration of lesions in different patients, as characterized by our approach, may contribute to more tailored treatment strategies and control measures in ongoing clade I mpox outbreaks.",2025-Jul-02,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40601777/,40601777,Science translational medicine,10.1126/scitranslmed.ads4773,"Interdisciplinary Biology Laboratory (iBLab), Division of Natural Science, Graduate School of Science, Nagoya University, Nagoya 4648601, Japan.; Centre for Infectious Disease Control, National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), Bilthoven 3721MA, Netherlands.; Interdisciplinary Biology Laboratory (iBLab), Division of Natural Science, Graduate School of Science, Nagoya University, Nagoya 4648601, Japan.; Interdisciplinary Biology Laboratory (iBLab), Division of Natural Science, Graduate School of Science, Nagoya University, Nagoya 4648601, Japan.; Interdisciplinary Biology Laboratory (iBLab), Division of Natural Science, Graduate School of Science, Nagoya University, Nagoya 4648601, Japan.; Disease Control and Prevention Centre, National Centre for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo 1628655, Japan.; Interdisciplinary Biology Laboratory (iBLab), Division of Natural Science, Graduate School of Science, Nagoya University, Nagoya 4648601, Japan.; Disease Control and Prevention Centre, National Centre for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo 1628655, Japan.; Disease Control and Prevention Centre, National Centre for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo 1628655, Japan.; Disease Control and Prevention Centre, National Centre for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo 1628655, Japan.; International Research Center for Neurointelligence, University of Tokyo Institutes for Advanced Study, Tokyo 1130033, Japan.; Research Center for Drug and Vaccine Development, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo 1620052, Japan.; Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford OX26GG, UK.; Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford OX26GG, UK.; Tsukuba Primate Research Center, National Institutes of Biomedical Innovation, Health and Nutrition (NIBN), Tsukuba 5670085, Japan.; Disease Control and Prevention Centre, National Centre for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo 1628655, Japan.; Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale, Ministère de la Santé Publique, Kinshasa 5345, Democratic Republic of the Congo.; Division of Medicine, US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), Fort Detrick, MD 21702-5011, USA.; Interdisciplinary Biology Laboratory (iBLab), Division of Natural Science, Graduate School of Science, Nagoya University, Nagoya 4648601, Japan.; Division of Medicine, US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), Fort Detrick, MD 21702-5011, USA.",

Despite their established safety and efficacy in numerous trials against cancers and infections, long-term clinical benefits have been modest. Most trials have employed DCs derived from blood monocytes (MoDC), but emerging evidence underscores the unique role of cDC1 in triggering potent antitumor immune responses and their intratumoral infiltration with favorable prognoses in many cancers. However, the scarcity of cDC1 in peripheral blood and the challenges in generating them in vitro have hindered a deeper understanding of their biology and their widespread application as cellular vaccines. Here, we present a novel serum-free culture system capable of generating billions of human cDC1s from CD34+ progenitors derived from cord or peripheral blood. The system leverages the requirement of Notch signaling for cDC1 differentiation and generates DCs that closely resemble in vivo cDC1s, exhibiting superior functions, including cellular antigen cross-presentation. This robust protocol enables the scalable production of cDC1s for both fundamental biological research and therapeutic applications.",2025-Jul-02,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40600891/,40600891,Cancer immunology research,10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-25-0034,"Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States.; Mater Research Institute-The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States.; Mater Research Institute-The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States.; Mater Research Institute-The University of Queensland, Brisbane, QLD, Australia.; Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States.",

Here we identify two biomarkers of O. viverrini infection and infection-associated CCA that could form the basis of novel antibody serodiagnostic tests for human liver fluke infection and associated cancer.",2025-Jul-01,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40595543/,40595543,Nature communications,10.1038/s41467-025-61043-2,"Department of Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, and Mekong Health Science Research Institute, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.; Department of Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, and Mekong Health Science Research Institute, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.; Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine, James Cook University, Cairns, QLD, Australia.; Vaccine R&D Center, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA.; Department of Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, and Mekong Health Science Research Institute, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.; Parasitology Reference and Research Laboratory, Centro Nacional de Microbiologia, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Majadahonda, Madrid, Spain.; Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine, James Cook University, Cairns, QLD, Australia.; Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.; Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.; Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.; Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.; Department of Parasitology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo, Japan.; Tropical Disease Research Center, Department of Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.; Department of Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, and Mekong Health Science Research Institute, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.; Tropical Disease Research Center, Department of Tropical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.; Vaccine R&D Center, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA.; Vaccine R&D Center, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA.; Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Tropical Medicine, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.; Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Tropical Medicine, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA.; Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine, James Cook University, Cairns, QLD, Australia.; Vaccine R&D Center, Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA.; Department of Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, and Mekong Health Science Research Institute, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.; Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Tropical Medicine, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, George Washington University, Washington, DC, USA. pbrindley@gwu.edu.; Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine, James Cook University, Cairns, QLD, Australia. alex.loukas@jcu.edu.au.; Department of Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, and Mekong Health Science Research Institute, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand.",
